    JOHN COMMENT:
    Unfortunately your code above has a number of mistakes:
    1. Your adding a "section" element to nest your "head" tag. 
    2. Your using a "style" element, but it's empty.
    3. Your not closing elements correctly. For example you're closing the "section" element before the "head" element.
    4. Your using a "section" element, but it's empty.

    Your code should look like the following:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Document</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        JOHN'S NOTES: This is where you'll add the "section" element.

        Your using invalid HTML syntax. Every HTML element has an opening and closing tag unless it's self-closing. Your code should look like:

                VS Code is telling you there's something wrong b/c some of your code is highlighted in red. You're not closing out the "img" element correctly. Your code should look like:

                <section>
                    <img src="./images/summer1.png" alt="Picture" />
                </section>

                Also, you'll want to use a more descriptive value for the "alt" attribute.

    You're using HTML elements outside of the "html" element.

<!--
    JOHN COMMENT:
    This is a good start Carol, but there are a number of issues in your HTML that needs to be corrected. Some red flags:
    1. There are a number of elements that are not correctly closed.
    2. There are a number of floating tags.
    3. Your code is not following HTML syntax standards i.e. adding HTML elements in the "head" element, having several "body" elements, and adding HTML outside of the "html" element
    What I would strongly suggest is reviewing my profile.html example and more importantly going back and reviewing week 1 once again. This is ultimately important because CSS builds on top of HTML and Bootstrap builds on top of CSS and HTML.

    While it's not mandatory, I'd suggest resubmitting this assignment so I can see that you've corrected the commented-out mistakes.

    Please let me know what I can do to help.
