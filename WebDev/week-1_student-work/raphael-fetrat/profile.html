        JOHN COMMENT:
        Two points:
        1. The "id" attribute is totally unnecessary b/c it's not being used anywhere. I would not add more code if it does not serve a purpose. Why? 
            a. More code, means more place where there can be human-related error.
            b. More code, means there's more places things can break.
            c. More code, means more places you and your peers need to debug.
        2. Make sure that your "id" attribute value does not have spaces. You can use hyphens, underscores, camelCase, snake_case, but never spaces. Why? 
            a. Spaces will cause problems with styling.
            b. Spaces will cause probles when pointing to HTML elements using the DOM (Document Object Model)
            c. Spaces will cause problems when firing functions.

    JOHN COMMENT:
    GREAT WORK Raphi on your W1 Workshop Assignment. Outside of one issue w/ you writing "id" attribute values, there's nothing I would change. Your HTML syntax is spot on, so FANTASTIC work!

    p.s. I love, love, love the picture of your pup and his/her Sister.
