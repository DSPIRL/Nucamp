        Not to say your HTML syntax is incorrect, I've just not seen it written in this manner before. More often than not you'll see this code broken up as follows:

        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

        You're missing the "title" element.
        <title>Your Webpage Title goes here</title>

        This will help w/ Search Engine Optimization or SEO.

        Unfortunately I cannot see any of your media as it wasn't part of your submission and you didn't include a screenshot. 

        I'm assuming an issue occurred here b/c you're using character reference &#39; which I believe is a single quotation. I'm unsure why you would add this to your "width" attribute value.

        I would highly recommend to always include the "target" attribute and value "_blank" when creating an "anchor" element that points to a source that directs the user away from your webpage.
