        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I was born in Denver, Colorado.</li>
            <li>I live in Tulsa, Oklahoma.</li>
            <li>I am currently a stay at home parent, but before that I worked as an IT Business Systems Analyst. </li>
            <li>My goal is to have a job that challenges me while allowing a good work life balance so that I can travel
                full time with my family.</li>
            <li>I would love to visit all of the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/findapark/index.htm">National Parks</a> in
                the United States.</li>

                JOHN COMMENT:
                You'll want to add the "target" attribute and value "_blank" to your link. This will open up a new tab rather redirect the user from your webpage.

                p.s. I LOVE this. I've visited Arches, Bryce, Crater Lake, Cuyahoga Valley, The Grand Canyon, Yosemite, and Zion. Next on the list is Glacier and the Grand Tetons.
