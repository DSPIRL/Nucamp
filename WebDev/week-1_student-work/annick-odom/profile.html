    <p>This past year, I was an apprentice in West Virginia's Folklife program. I studied fiddle with Gerry Milnes. If
        you'd like to hear the kind of music I made during this apprenticeship, you can listen to a field recording
        below. You'll hear Melvin Wine (a great West Virginian fiddler) playing <em>The Possum's Tail is Bare</em>.
